# Vr-creation-with-Unity-project-2023
Version control set up for my Unity vr development path.

Combination of version control and overall documentation of my VR project for Unity's Create with VR course. 
Also utilizing this project for events and as a showcase for my virtual reality research and development internship with the University at Albany SUNY.
If you see some UAlbany theming, it is for this reason, but overall the functionality remains the same. 

More to come with this project as I work on iterations, builds, and personal projects in my Unity VR development.
